The title of this project is 'Polish & Plait Beauty Bar Website'.
Buhle Maqhashu is responsible for this project.
We were tasked to design a functional and visually appealing website that will help a business to get more engagement. I chose to create a fictional business called Polish & Plait Beauty Bar.
The goals and objectives of this webiste are to nsure that people around Port Elizabeth can reach us online to view our work, contact us, book appointments, and leave reviews.
